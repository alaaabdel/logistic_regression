# logistic_regression

In this study, two sample data sets are analyzed using logistic regression approach.
To this end, first and by using logistic regression, the data sets are
fitted in 1st to 4th order models. Then, using cross validation method, the
best model is picked. To this end, different combination of learning rates and
iteration numbers are used and compared to each other. At the end, methods
such as, normalization, feature selection and oversampling were used to
improve the accuracy of the picked fitting model.
